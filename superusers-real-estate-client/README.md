# Team-superusers

## Goal

This project The goal of this team is to come up with a suitable solution on Housing/Real Estate.
Further more, it's going to be an extreme flexible web applications (mobile app later on) that house/estate/land and properties owners would be able to sell/rent/lease their properties at ease. There's going to be an overall Amin panel that would control users(including other necessary permissions) and users(property owners) will be able to upload pictures of their properties with a price tag, reach an agreement and we'll do the marketing (adds).
I've been able to create a sign up/sign-in system in the back end using nodejs, apollo-server, express, and mongoDB. And I've initialized a landing page for the client side using React and apollo-react.
Please let me know if you have anything to say.

## Client Architecture
